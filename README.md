# UK Case Study: Economic Growth and Health Outcomes

## Project Description
This project investigates the relationship between economic growth (measured by GDP per capita) and health outcomes (specifically Infant Mortality Rate - IMR) in the United Kingdom from 1960 to 2015. It also explores the impact of health expenditure as a percentage of GDP on IMR for the period 2000-2015. The analysis employs statistical modeling, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and Random Forest regression, to understand these complex dynamics.

## Files in This Repository

*   `A Case Study of the United Kingdom.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Plots are displayed inline within the notebook.
*   `longitudinal_data.csv`: The primary dataset containing yearly data for GDP per capita (current US$) and Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births) for the UK from 1960-2015.
*   `uk_health_expenditure_gdp_wbgapi.csv`: This file is **generated by the notebook** upon its first run. It contains data on health expenditure as a percentage of GDP for the UK from 2000-2015, downloaded from the World Bank.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required to run the notebook.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

*   **`longitudinal_data.csv`**: The data for GDP per capita (Indicator: `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD`) and Infant Mortality Rate (Indicator: `SP.DYN.IMRT.IN`) for the United Kingdom were originally sourced from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI).
*   **`uk_health_expenditure_gdp_wbgapi.csv`**: Data for Health Expenditure, current (% of GDP) (Indicator: `SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS`) for the United Kingdom is downloaded directly from the World Bank WDI via the `wbgapi` library within the Jupyter Notebook for the years 2000-2015.
