# UK Case Study: Economic Growth and Health Outcomes

## Project Description
This project investigates the relationship between economic growth (measured by GDP per capita) and health outcomes (specifically Infant Mortality Rate - IMR) in the United Kingdom from 1960 to 2015. It also explores the impact of health expenditure as a percentage of GDP on IMR for the period 2000-2015. The analysis employs statistical modeling, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and Random Forest regression, to understand these complex dynamics.

## Files in This Repository

*   `A Case Study of the United Kingdom.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Plots are displayed inline within the notebook.
*   `longitudinal_data.csv`: The primary dataset containing yearly data for GDP per capita (current US$) and Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births) for the UK from 1960-2015.
*   `uk_health_expenditure_gdp_wbgapi.csv`: This file is **generated by the notebook** upon its first run. It contains data on health expenditure as a percentage of GDP for the UK from 2000-2015, downloaded from the World Bank.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required to run the notebook.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

*   **`longitudinal_data.csv`**: The data for GDP per capita (Indicator: `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD`) and Infant Mortality Rate (Indicator: `SP.DYN.IMRT.IN`) for the United Kingdom were originally sourced from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI).
*   **`uk_health_expenditure_gdp_wbgapi.csv`**: Data for Health Expenditure, current (% of GDP) (Indicator: `SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS`) for the United Kingdom is downloaded directly from the World Bank WDI via the `wbgapi` library within the Jupyter Notebook for the years 2000-2015.

## Setup and Usage

To run this analysis:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open and run the `A Case Study of the United Kingdom.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

    The notebook will:
    *   Download health expenditure data if not already present.
    *   Perform all data analysis and modeling.
    *   Display results and all generated plots inline.

## Summary of Key Findings

*   There is a strong inverse relationship between GDP per capita and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in the UK over the period 1960-2015. As GDP per capita increased, IMR generally decreased.
*   A polynomial regression model provided a better fit for the GDP vs. IMR relationship over the entire period (1960-2015) compared to a simple linear regression, suggesting non-linear dynamics.
*   For the more recent period (2000-2015), when considering both GDP per capita and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP:
    *   Both factors were found to be significant in predicting IMR.
    *   The Random Forest Regressor model indicated that health expenditure as a percentage of GDP was a more dominant factor than GDP per capita in explaining variations in IMR during this specific period.

This analysis highlights the complex interplay of economic development and specific health investments in influencing public health outcomes.
